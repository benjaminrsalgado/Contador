# 📱 Super Pro Counter 

A small SwiftUI project to count how many times you press a button simple, fun, and a great practice for SwiftUI animations and state management!

## 🎮 How It Works

Just open the app and tap the **"Aumentar"** button (means *Increase* in Spanish).  
Each tap:

- 🔢 Increases the counter.

- ✍️ Updates the message below the number.

## 🛠️ Built With
